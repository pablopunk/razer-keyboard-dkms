# Sign DKMS modules for Razer keyboards

If you install Polychromatic for your Razer keyboard and it doesn't work, this can fix it. Tested on Elementary OS Juno (Ubuntu 18.04).

## Usage

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablopunk/razer-keyboard-dkms/master/sign-dkms.sh)"
```

Now reboot :)
